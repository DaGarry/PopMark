This benchmark is for old computer that dont support other benchmark because of support. Like lack of support for directX 11, 12 etc.
It's a Dual Benchmark so you need a cpu and gpu at the same "level". For example: 3060 and a 11600 so its not good for benchmarking a mining setup, etc.
This benchmark was mostly made for Dr so he could benchmark his scrappers (pc's made from old pc parts).
Feel free to use or contribute to this code. :)
